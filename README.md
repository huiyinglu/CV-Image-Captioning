# CV-Image-Captioning
Combine CNN and RNN networks to automatically produces captions, given an input image.

In this project, we design a CNN-RNN model for automatically generating captions for given input images. The dataset we are using is the Microsoft C*ommon *Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset is a large-scale dataset for scene understanding. The dataset is commonly used to train and benchmark object detection, segmentation, and captioning algorithms.
